## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Daniela! 

**Aspiring Data Scientist| Data Science and Cognitive Science Grad | UC Berkeley Class of 2025**  

Data is more than analysis; it is about uncovering trends that shape peopleâ€™s decisions. Iâ€™ve found the value in discovering patterns that hide within everyday data. A spreadsheet might hold patterns that are not obvious, and I get excited about discovering them. When exploring, I research related information to understand the how and why behind the data.

Iâ€™ve noticed a gap between the raw data and the people who need to use it. My goal is to bridge this gap with visualization tools and clear communication, helping others understand the information enough to make informed decisions for both their short-term and long-term goals.
