## üëã Hello, I'm Daniela! 

**Aspiring Data Scientist| Data Science and Cognitive Science Grad | UC Berkeley Class of 2025**  

Data is more than analysis; it is about uncovering trends that shape people‚Äôs decisions. I‚Äôve found the value in discovering patterns that hide within everyday data. I get excited about discovering these patterns and the context behind them, understanding the "how" and "why". My goal is to bridge that gap by using clear communication and visualization tools, making data accessible and actionable.
